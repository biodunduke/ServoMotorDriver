### Introduction  
For moving objects, it is imperative that they have parts that aid in the movement. Motors are mostly used in the movement of objects. This project focuses on powering a servo motor using Raspberry Pi.
#### Limitation:   
The Raspberry Pi only has one PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) channel on its GPIO. To overcome this limitation, I used the Adafruit's 16-channel 12-bit PWM/Servo driver (PCA9685). The PCA9685 connects to the Raspberry Pi with two pins on the Pi's I2C channel. It can drive up to 16 PWM simultaneously with adding extra overhead processing to the Pi.
